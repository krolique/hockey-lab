# Change Log
The change log is the place where we write down any changes that we release.
The right word might be **most** only because there are exceptions to this
rule that might arise in debates on semantic meaning of any, however for the sake of
brevity let's assume **any** and **most** are interchangeable.

You should update this document as you update `master` (main line) branch
with new features, bug fixes or anything else that mutates our source. The
format is simple. Keep adding sections to this markdown document that describe
mutation. Please append to the bottom of this file as new sections are being
added.

Example section

```
## [v0.1.0] - 2018-02-21
### Added
- CHANGELOG documentation
```

The `verbs` should be consistent set such as **added**, **changed**
or **fixed**. You're not trying to create meaningful nomenclature through
these sections but rather group things together.

If you don't know the release number or the date simply create a **TBD**
section such as this:

```
## [TBD] - TBD
### Changed
- Something I've changed and decided to add this to the release log

```

## [0.0.1] - 2018-05-18
### Changed
- Renamed the repo, subsequently had to change documentation and other
upkeep items in the setup.
